Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could

To where it bent in the undergrowth.
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same.
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.

Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh

Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference

And be one traveler, long I stood
And both that morning equally lay
And having perhaps the better claim,
And looked down one as far as I could
And sorry I could not travel both
And that has made all the difference
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Had worn them really about the same.
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
I took the one less traveled by,
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Then took the other, as just as fair,
Though as for that the passing there
To where it bent in the undergrowth.
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
